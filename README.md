# Overview

The program created in this repository is a basic java calculator that takes user input then calculates an answer based on what numbers and operator is given by the user.

I created this program to learn Java. No other reason. That's it, just learning a new language.

# Development Environment

I had to use a java scanner to allow the program to take the user input and remember it for the calculator. 

I used java and no libraries for this program.

# Future Work

* First i would like to change how the operator is put into the calculator. Currently it asks for a number related to a operator. However i'd like to change this so that the user can actually put in the operator instead.
* Second i want to open the calculator for more equations rather then just the basic 4 of multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. I want to open it up for squaring numbers, finding the square root, maybe have parenthesis to place equations inside of equations.
